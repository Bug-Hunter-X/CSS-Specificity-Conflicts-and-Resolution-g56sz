The following CSS code has a common error that can be difficult to track down:  Specificity Conflicts.  This occurs when multiple CSS selectors target the same element, and the browser doesn't know which style to apply.  Consider this example:

```css
div p { color: blue; }
.important p { color: red; }
<div>
  <p class="important">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

The `div p` selector has a lower specificity than the `.important p` selector. However, the browser might not always behave as expected in these situations.
